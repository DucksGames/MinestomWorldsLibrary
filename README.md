# MinestomWorldsLibrary

You can find this library @ https://jitpack.io/#GamerDuck123/MinestomWorldsLibrary

### IMPORTANT
Currently this Library uses a hard fork of Polar, this removes all support for minestom-ce, this will be changed in the future and minestom-ce will be supported later, but for right now it only supports the official version of Minestom# MinestomWorldsLibrary
